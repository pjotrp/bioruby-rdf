# Semantic web for BioRuby!

In this document we describe using a triple store for bioinformatics,
mostly using Ruby. While the semantic is still, mostly, vapourware in
biology, the ideas and tools can be very useful for reasoning about
relationships between genes, pathways, enrichment etc. In this library
we aim to use a local triple store, feed it with information, query it
using [SPARQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL), and provide it
with a nice user interface for biologists. Triples may link-out to
other semantic web connections.

Enjoy,
