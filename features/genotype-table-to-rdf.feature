Feature: Convert genotype table to RDF

  bio-table can convert data to RDF. A genotype table sets the genotype
  of an indidual at a marker location to either A,B or H(etereozygous).
  We want to store that in RDF so the genotype can be queried.

  Scenario: Read a comma separated genotype table and write RDF
    Given a comma separated table
